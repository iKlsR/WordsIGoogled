# Words I Googled

Here is a list of words that I've come across in books, traditional media, or conversations that I didn't know the explicit meaning of. Some of these can be discerned by context and will show my best guess at the time then the actual meaning once looked up. *If there exists an online link for where I found the word I will include that as well*. After the first year I will archive the years in their own files. For brevity I will choose the shortest definitions.
